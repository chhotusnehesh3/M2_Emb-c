# Passenger-controlled seat heater case study
## Introduction
 Now a days many countries are facing problem with cooling issue due to weather conditions because of that the vechicle seats are getting cold and making the passenger drive the vechile uncomfortably ,So inorder to resolve this issue we have coe up with an idea that is seat heater controlled by the passenger .

So in nowdays everything is becoming automated and everyone is looking for the new products to made the life easier.

In our project the main aim is to design and develop the system which is capable of monitoring the passanger's existance and Heat Monitoring and Displaying.

Some vehicles come with car seat warmers, which heat up the seat with the push of a button. Normally the buttons are located on the side of the driver and passenger door. In some vehicles, just the bottom of the seat warms up, where in others both the bottom and back warm up. Seat warmers were first introduced by Cadillac in 1966 to help with backaches.

## Benefits of Seat Heater
Heated seats can make cars much more comfortable in the winter, or for those who often get cold even in the summer. The heater in most vehicles work well, but the carâ€™s seat warmer is close to your body allowing you to warm up faster. In some cases, the seat warms up before the rest of the vehicle does.
## Basic Requirements 

* Hardware Equipment
* Software


## Used components
The Following are the important components to build Passenger Controlled Seat heater
 * Temperature sensor
 * switches
 * display
 * led for indication
 * potential Switch
 * resister
## Features
 * If the passager in side the car than switch is ON
 * Passanger was existed in the vehicle it will gives the indication
 * After the indication it will determine the heat.
 * Driver and the passanger can have the access to modifying the temperature in the vehicle.
 * The passanger can modify the temperature by watching the display as the display is given in the system
 * Modular Based Programming
# SWOT Analysis- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities threats
## Strengths
 * User Friendly.
 * Easy to modify the temperature value
 * The system is robust
 * Low cost.
 * Modular Based Program
## Weakness
 * It's only applicable for the countries which are having having low temperature.
## Opportunities
 * It can be implemented by adding heater along with air conditioners so that it will be helpful all the countries.
## Threats
 * Not suitable for average or high temperature environment.
## 4W's and 1'H
 * WHAT Passanger seat and Heat Monitoring System.
 * WHERE Used in automotive industry,
 * WHEN At low temperature,
 * WHY For being healthy.
 * HOW Operates by modifying the temperature
